        species and over 100,000 varieties. They are oftern grown as houseplants, 
        or added to floral displays. But not all orchilds are tropical beauties. 
        Wild orchids grow worldwide and can be found on every continent except 
        <b>Antarcita</b>. These flowers have earned the reputation as difficult 
        to grow, probably due to their need for filtered light and high relative

        are surprisingly easy to grow as a houseplant.
