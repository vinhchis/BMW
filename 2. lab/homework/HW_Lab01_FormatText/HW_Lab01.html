    <p>
        Yogurt is gairly easy to make at home and the reult is much better in flavor 
        and consistency than most commercial yogurt. You'll save money making your own, 
        and also be able to choose what doesn't go into yogurt (commercial brands often 
        include thickeners and other non-daily ingredients).
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 quart/1 litter milk</li>
        <li>
            2 tablespoons yogurt (with active cultures: all commercial brands will state
            on the contianer if the yogurt contains active cultures.)
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Step to Make It</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Gently heat the milk over medium-low heat until it reaches 180<sup>o</sup>F/82<sup>o</sup>C. 
            Turn off the heat and the milk cool down to between 106<sup>o</sup>F/41<sup>o</sup>C and 110<sup>o</sup>F/43<sup>o</sup>C.
        </li>
        <li>
            While the heated milk is cooling, wash the jars and leave them filled with 
            hot water so the glass will be warm when you add the yogurt.
        </li>
        <li>
            When the milk has cooled enough, warm a large bowl or measuring cup by filling it 
            with hot water. Empty out the water. Strain the milk through a fine mesh strainer 
            into the warmed bowl. Whisk in the yogurt. Pour out the water in the jars and pour 
            in the milk plus yogurt mixture. Fasten the lids.
        </li>
        <li>
            Place the jars in a warm but not hot place where they can remain undisturbed for 
            8 hours or overnight. An old fashioned oven in which the pilot light is always on 
            is perfect. So is an oven with the light turned on but the heat off. Another option 
            is a food dehydrator set to 110<sup>o</sup>F/43<sup>o</sup>C with the trays removed to make room for the jars. 
            Or you could buy a special yogurt maker that maintains the ideal temperature.
        </li>
        <li>
            Be careful <strong>not</strong> to jostle the jars while the active yogurt cultures are working 
            on the milk. Yogurt is very finicky about this, and will sometimes not set up well 
            if the jars are moved during this period.
        </li>
        <li>
            Transfer the jars to the refrigerator.
        </li>
    </ol>
