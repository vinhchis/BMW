        The <a href="https://vi.wikipedia.org/wiki/Briard">briard</a>, or erger de brie, 
        is a large bredd of dog traditionally used as a herder and guardian of sheep.
    </p>
    <h2>Breed History</h2>
    <p>The brianrd, which is believed to have riginated in France, has been bred for 
        centuries to herd and to protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as
        sentries, messengers and to search for woounded soldiers because of its fine 
        sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War alomost to the point 
        of extinction.

    <p>
        Currently the population of briards is slowly recovering. <span class="names">Charlemagne, 
        Napolon, Thomas Jefferson and Lafayetee</span> all owned briards.
